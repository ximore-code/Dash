## Have an Issue?

Dashing is no longer being actively maintained.

1. Check the [Troubleshooting Guide](https://github.com/Shopify/dashing/wiki#how-tos) in the wiki.
2. Use the [GitHub Issue Search](https://help.github.com/articles/searching-issues/) to check if the issue has already been reported.
3. You can ask your issue on the tracker, but your best bet is to go to [Stack Overflow](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/dashing)

If you feel that you have a really amazing, super neato idea that should be a part of Dashing, it may be a good candidate for an external Gem which supercharges a project. An excellent example of this is
[dashing-contrib](https://github.com/QubitProducts/dashing-contrib). If you
do create a third-party extension for Dashing, please add it [here](https://github.com/Shopify/dashing/wiki/Additional-Widgets#other-third-party-tools).
